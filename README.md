# FPGA Architecture Mastery

## Vision
This repository documents my journey toward mastering FPGA-based digital architecture design, RTL engineering, and EDA-driven hardware optimization using Xilinx Vivado.

The objective is to develop industry-level competence in:

- Synthesizable RTL design
- Timing-driven architecture
- Resource-aware FPGA implementation
- Custom RISC processor design
- DSP accelerator architectures
- System-level hardware integration

---

## Tools & Environment

- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite
- Verilog HDL
- Target: FPGA-based implementation

---

## Roadmap Structure

### Phase 1: RTL Foundations
Core digital building blocks with synthesis and timing analysis.

### Phase 2: FPGA & EDA Workflow
Timing closure, constraints, resource utilization, architectural trade-offs.

### Phase 3: Custom RISC CPU
Design and implementation of a parameterized RISC processor.

### Phase 4: DSP Architectures
FIR filters, MAC units, pipelined multipliers, and optimization studies.

### Phase 5: System-Level Integration
CPU + DSP acceleration and memory-mapped architectures.
